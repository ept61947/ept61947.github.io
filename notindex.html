<p>The ginkgo (<span style="font-style:italic">Ginkgo biloba</span>) is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in
the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,” in that there are no closely
related species still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.</p><p>An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”),
meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit.</p></div>
